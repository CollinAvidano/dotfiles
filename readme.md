My personal configuration files
The folders here are intended to be used as gnu stow modules. So editing configs here will change there current versions in their respective symlinked locations. Super conveinent.
cfg contains an untested auto installer for the other modules as well install procedures for some other apps I need in my day to day.
zsh contains .oh-my-zsh as a submodule so I can keep a constant version and just pull it with out any other script hassles.
system contains alot of the traditional environment variables that get set at a shells startup. Put them in their own scripts so its a little more organized.
scripts contains miscellanous scripts I have found helpful throughout my school and work. The actual folder they get linked to is on path.
